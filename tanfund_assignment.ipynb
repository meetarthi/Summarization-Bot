            "  Crowdholding.com is a C2B (consumer-to-business) application that connects startups with their customers to gather feedback on ideas and solutions. Startups choose a percentage of revenue to be distributed as a reward, called 'Crowdshares', to those who contribute with ideas, solutions and feedback. This allows startups to access capital, preserve equity, and recruit a team without giving up control. Crowdholders benefit from passive income and get to know the people who actually care about the problem they're solving.  The company identified repeatable strategies to acquire customers, such as word-of-mouth, email lists, affiliate networks, social media, and internet advertising. They are targeting startups in the USA with 2-25 employees and a budget of $50-100K, as well as early adopters aged 18-34 who are motivated by new skills, joining a community, and recognition.  They are raising $300K to test and launch their platform. Their revenue model is 10% shared revenue and 5% of capital raised. They have identified 3 acquisition channels for organic growth, sales, and marketing.\n",
